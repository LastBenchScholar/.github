# LastBenchScholar

**LastBenchScholar** is a student-centric digital ecosystem created to support growth, collaboration, and innovation in the academic community. Our platform integrates a suite of web and mobile applications that empower students to learn, build, share, and grow—together.

## 🌐 Our Vision

We aim to build a one-stop hub for students where ideas are transformed into projects, discussions spark creativity, and skills are nurtured through hands-on experience.

## 🚀 What We’re Building

LastBenchScholar is more than just a project—it's a movement. Here's what we're working on:

### 🔗 Unified Ecosystem with SSO
All our apps are integrated through a secure **Single Sign-On (SSO)** system to allow seamless access with one account across all subdomains.

### 🛠️ Active Projects

- [**Chat App**](https://chat.lastbenchscholar.com) – Real-time messaging platform for open discussions and teamwork.
- [**Blog App**](https://blog.lastbenchscholar.com) – A student blog to publish ideas, tutorials, and experiences.
- [**Single Sign-On**](https://sso.lastbenchscholar.com) – An authentication system to integrate all LBS apps.
- [More coming soon...] 🚧
